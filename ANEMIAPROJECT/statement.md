# Project Statement

**Project Title:** Anemia Severity Prediction Using Routine Blood Parameters  
**Student:** Bhumika Sharma  
**Registration No.:** 25BOE10070  
**Course:** B.Tech Bioengineering (Fundamentals of AI & ML)  
**Instructor:** Prof. Vivek Parashar  
**University:** VIT Bhopal University

## Problem Statement
Anemia is very common, and many people only realize its severity after symptoms get worse. Since CBC tests are already a part of routine checkups, I wanted to build a small machine learning model that can estimate anemia severity (Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe) using these basic blood values. The goal is not to replace medical diagnosis but to create an early-screening type of tool using simple machine learning techniques.

## Scope of the Project
The work mainly focuses on:
- Cleaning and preparing synthetic CBC data  
- Training a multiclass classification ML model  
- Saving the trained model and preprocessing scaler  
- A simple Python script for trying out predictions  
- Adding diagrams (workflow, UML, etc.) to explain the system flow  

The scope is limited to ML classification on tabular data only and does not include clinical decision support or real patient datasets.

## High-Level Features
- Preprocessing of routine CBC parameters  
- Multiclass anemia severity prediction  
- Quick prediction script to test the model  
- Confusion matrix and evaluation metrics  
- UML diagrams and workflow diagrams for documentation  

## Target Users
The project is mainly useful for:
- Students learning AI/ML applications in healthcare  
- Beginners practicing classification models  
- Educators or clinicians who want a simple demo of ML with CBC data
